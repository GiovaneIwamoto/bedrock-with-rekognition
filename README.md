# BEDROCK WITH REKOGNITION

### **OVERVIEW**

The objective of this project is to create an API using the serverless framework, which will receive images manually uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket, and utilize the Amazon Rekognition service to identify people's faces and their emotions. Additionally, it will also identify pets and provide care tips for them through integration with the Amazon Bedrock service. Throughout this process, logs will be sent to Amazon CloudWatch.

### **AWS SERVICES**

- **Amazon Rekognition**

A powerful image analysis service that uses deep learning technology to identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities. In this project, AWS Rekognition is employed to detect faces and analyze the emotions displayed in the images. The service is capable of identifying a range of emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more, with high accuracy. Additionally, AWS Rekognition is used to detect pets and classify their breeds, providing a robust foundation for further processing and analysis.

- **Amazon Bedrock**

The project utilizes Amazon Titan-Text-Express-V1, an advanced generative AI tool, to enhance its capability in generating specific care tips based on the detected breed of the pet. Titan-Text-Express-V1 employs state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models to create human-like text responses, ensuring that the generated tips are not only accurate but also contextually relevant to the pet's breed characteristics.

### **FUNCTIONALITIES**

- **Facial and Pet Recognition**

The facial and pet recognition functionality identifies both human faces and their apparent emotions in a photo, as well as pets, and provides specific care tips for the detected pet breeds.

| Method | Endpoint                                                    | Description                |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| POST   | https://xxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/vision | Rekognition for faces only |
| POST   | https://xxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v2/vision | Rekognition faces and pets |

To utilize the API, the following JSON format must be used for POST requests. This format specifies the necessary details for the API to access and process the images stored in your S3 bucket:

```JSON
{
    "bucket": "my_bucket_s3",
   "imageName": "image_example.jpg"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Users are required to create their own Amazon S3 bucket and manually upload photos to this bucket. The API will utilize the photos stored in this user-created bucket for processing.

The expected response format is as follows:

```JSON
{
   "url_to_image": "https://myphotos/test.jpg",
   "created_image": "02-02-2023 17:00:00",
   "faces": [

         "Name": "Golden Retriever"
      }
      ],
      "Tips": "Tips about Golden Retriever: Golden retrievers are known for their love of water and enjoy swimming and playing in the water.

      }
   ]
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If there are timeout errors in the request, ensure that the Lambda function generated by Serverless named vision-dev-visionV2 has enough timeout to run the AWS Rekognition and Bedrock services.
